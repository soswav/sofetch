     fetch tool based on nitch which is based on something which is based on neofetch


// info
  sofetch ("so" for short) is a fetch tool that tries to be as fast as
  possible (sounds familiar?) while also being good-looking!

  currently, this is being maintained by both abb3v and soswav (even though
  i don't do anything (mostly))
// frequently asked questions (not really, but you get it)
  // why the name?
    the name comes from the fact that almost every
	unixporn setup has either neofetch or a neofetch-based fetch tool!
  // why make this?
    ...i was bored! this seemed simple enough as well (spoiler: it wasn't!)
  // how fast is this compared to nitch?

  // how can i contribute?
